# Feeder Main

## An adventure in Generative Art

### Inspiration
In 2024, a huge puddle showed up at a Calgary intersection. A few hours later, the city found out that [Calgary's Bearspaw South Feeder Main had a major water leak](https://globalnews.ca/news/10626802/calgary-feeder-main-break-ballpark-cost/). 
After digging into it, they discovered the leak happened because of [lots of small changes to the feeder’s structure over a long time](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-bearspaw-south-feeder-main-preliminary-findings-1.7385334#:~:text=Built%20in%201975%2C%20the%20feeder,the%20city's%20treated%20water%20supply.). 
While trying to save water and wondering if this was a sneak peek at an apocalyptic future, I couldn’t help but think of the parallel with our own "feeder main"—the spinal cord. 
We rely on it so much, but we don’t take care of it the way we should. And just like the water main, small changes over time can lead to big problems for our overall health.

### Motivation
A series of [blog posts by Nicola Rennie](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/getting-started-generative-art/) and the [workshop materials from Daniele Navarro](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/) got me wondering if someone like me—a mere mortal—could turn data frames into art. 
Inspired by this [hands-on, step-by-step tutorial by Michael Freeman](http://mfviz.com/r-image-art/), I decided to create a [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram), a type of tessellation, based on our feeder main.

Using a [lateral X-ray of the neck with a cervical collar in a patient with cervical spine trauma by Nevit Dilmen, CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Medical_X-Ray_imaging_RAH06_nevit.jpg) as a starting point, 
I turned to some amazing R packages—[ggvoronoi](https://github.com/garretrc/ggvoronoi), [cropcircles](https://github.com/doehm/cropcircles), [imager](https://asgr.github.io/imager/), and [magick](https://docs.ropensci.org/magick/articles/intro.html#read-and-write)—to bring the idea to life.

And guess what? The dream came true!  

I hope you enjoy the art piece, and I encourage you to use the open-source code included with it to embark on your own adventures in generative art.
